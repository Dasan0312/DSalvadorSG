Hello everyone! ðŸ‘‹:grinning: 

I'm Salvador. I'm working as Front-end Developer on Novacore, as well as a freelance mobile dev. My coding language :heart: is Flutter. 

:nerd_face: Iâ€™ve worked in 2 apps fully published as a software engineer & UI/UX designer, both build from scratch, giving them maintenance continuously.

:iphone: Right now I've been working on a medical app as freelance using Flutter.

ðŸ’¬ If given the chance, I'll recommend Flutter to all people.

Favorite editor: VS Code
